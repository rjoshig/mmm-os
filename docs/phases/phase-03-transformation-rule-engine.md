# Phase 3 — Transformation Rule Engine

**Depends on:** Phases 0, 2 · **Status:** Not started · **MVP:** yes (Phases 0–4)

Cross-cutting: config-as-data (CC-4), idempotent jobs (CC-6), traceability (CC-3).

## Objective

Apply declarative, config-driven transformations that clean and standardise
mapped data, with live before/after preview.

## Scope

- **In:** declarative rule schema; operation library; ordered rule application;
  layered rules; preview.
- **Out:** validation/anomaly (Phase 4), AI suggestions (Phase 5), UI (Phase 6).

## Functional Requirements

- **P3-1 Rule schema:** each rule stored as data: `{ id, target_field, operation, params, condition, order }`. *(See [`../data-model.md`](../data-model.md), Appendix D.)*
- **P3-2 Operation library (v1):** MUST include `map_value`, `rename_column`, `cast_type`, `parse_date`, `convert_currency`, `dedupe`, `reshape` (wide→long), `fill_missing`, `trim/normalize_text`. MUST be **extensible** (new operation = new handler, no rewrite).
- **P3-3 Escape hatch:** provide a `custom` rule type for the ~10% of cases the library doesn't cover. *(Scope of this is OQ-3.1.)*
- **P3-4 Ordered application:** rules apply in defined order; deterministic output.
- **P3-5 Layered rules:** global defaults → template rules → customer overrides, merged at runtime.
- **P3-6 Taxonomy harmonisation:** `map_value` MUST support collapsing raw values to canonical taxonomy terms (e.g. `FB`, `fb_ads` → `Facebook`).
- **P3-7 Preview:** given a rule (or rule set) + sample rows, return **before/after** without persisting — this powers the UI later.
- **P3-8 Versioning:** rule sets versioned; outputs traceable to the rule-set version applied.

## Deliverables

- Rule engine (declarative, ordered, layered).
- v1 operation handlers + `custom` escape hatch.
- Preview service (before/after on sample rows).
- Versioned `rule_set` storage.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Define a `map_value` rule collapsing 3 raw channel spellings to one canonical value → applied output shows the single canonical value.
- Define `parse_date` + `convert_currency` + `dedupe` → output reflects all three in order, deterministically.
- Preview endpoint returns correct before/after for a rule set on sample rows without writing anything.
- Re-running with the same rule-set version yields identical output (idempotent).

## Open Questions

- **OQ-3.1** — ✅ Resolved: `custom` = a **sandboxed expression language** (restricted DSL over the row/field context; no arbitrary code, imports, or I/O; allowlisted ops; resource-bounded). The evaluator is security-critical — strict allowlist + hard resource limits + adversarial tests. Grammar/function set finalised in this phase. See ADR-004.
- **OQ-3.2** — ✅ Resolved (draft): reshape config model `{ id_vars, value_vars | value_var_pattern, var_name → dimension, value_name → measure }`; deterministic. Edge cases refined during implementation.

_All Phase-3 open questions resolved. See [`../open-questions.md`](../open-questions.md)._

## Sub-phases

TBD — to be broken down before implementation.
